🌐 Azure Data Engineering / AI Roadmap — 12-Month Portfolio

From BI Developer → Azure Data Engineer → AI-Enhanced Data Solutions

This repository documents my structured journey transitioning from a BI developer (SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, Power BI) to a modern cloud Data Engineer, specialising in:

Azure Data Factory

Azure Synapse Serverless SQL & Dedicated SQL Pools

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Databricks (SQL, PySpark, Delta Lake)

Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Microsoft Fabric (BI + Lakehouse)

AI-augmented analytics + Azure AI integrations

It contains hands-on labs, real Azure-architecture implementations, notebooks, SQL scripts, pipelines, CI/CD examples, and a documented 12-month learning plan.

This is both a portfolio showcase and a knowledge base as I progress toward becoming a Cloud + AI Data Engineer.

⭐ Career Goal

Build production-grade data engineering solutions in Azure, integrate AI capabilities into analytics pipelines, and become a senior engineer capable of architecting Lakehouse, medallion, event-driven, and ML-ready platforms.
